#### Introduction

At present, big data analysis technology has rapidly developed. Thanks to the growth of advanced computerization, the breakthrough of data storage and extraction technology and the growing Internet, we are able to handle massive data. According to previous research, most of the unstructured data are currently buried in text data, and they are mainly distributed on the Internet. Today, the online community and news media have become the main field of information acquisition and transmission for modern people. For example, if we want to buy new sneakers, we would collect reviews of products from the online community and weigh our decision based on others suggestions; or if we want to know what movie is good, we can also search for reviews from online communities.

In addition, sentiment analysis research is getting more and more attention with an attempt to obtain trends in public by mining opinions that are subjective statements that reflect people’s sentiments or perceptions about topics (Pang et al., 2002). Thanks to the optimization of natural language processing technology, it helps us to accurately analyze the sentiment and opinions of massive texts. Sentiment analysis is an important area of natural language processing (NLP) research. While previous researches on emotions mainly focused on detecting the emotions that the authors of the documents were expressing, it is worthy of note that the reader-emotions, in some aspects, differ from that of the authors and may be even more complex (Lin et al., 2008; Tang and Chen, 2012) , for example,  a news article with the title “The price of crude oil will rise 0.5% next week” is just objectively reporting an event without any emotion, but it may invoke emotions like angry or worried in its readers. Furthermore, it is possible to get more sponsorship opportunities from the company or manufacturer if the articles describing a certain product are able to promote greater emotional resonance in the readers. Online commerce is becoming more important, and more and more customers are able to review online to determine their purchase.

Based on the above researches, this article intends to explore a method for analyzing the emotions of readers of short texts through movie reviews in the news and film communities. Experimental results show that our method can effectively identify different reader emotion categories. In addition, our research can effectively obtain public opinion on related topics and more detailed information about it. Then, we further test the accuracy of the classifier's movie review text data in different languages.
