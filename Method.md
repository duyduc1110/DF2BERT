# 3 BERT and Feature Extraction
## 3.1 BERT
## 3.2 Feature Extraction


# Performace Evaluation
## Experimental Setting
We primarily follow the orignial BERT optimaztion hyperparameters with Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015): beta1 = 0.9, beta2 = 0.9, learning rate = 1e-6 and 
We reimplement BERT with RoBERTa setting (Liu et al., 2019) with the following parameters
The original BERT was optimized with Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015) with the following parameters: beta1 = 0.9, beta2 = 0.9, learning rate = 1e-6 and
