## Introduction

why : since 80% of information is wide spread on social media and it is in the text form.

value: Organizations/Enterprises can know customer's behavior about their products/companies so that they can have fast responses

motivation ? combine old-fashion way (CNN) and new way (BERT)

## Basic Paper Related Work

+ Movie review topic paper before(sentiment analysis)
+ Short text
+ Social media topic(text-mining) 

## Basic Methods: (Bonz)

#### Experiment: (Bonz)

* TFIDF + 6ML

* WE + CNN/RNN

* BERT-base(fine-tuning)

* BERT-base + CNN 

* LLR-BERT (main focus)

#### Result 

Which is the best way on testing data? (don't have it now lol!!!)

#### Discussion

* RCNN(Further optional step)

## Conclusion

Conclude our experiments and findings, the limitation of the work, and false analysis. What we can do for the further research.
